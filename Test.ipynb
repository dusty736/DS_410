    "I think the most useful type of plot out of the above is the kernal density estimation plot.  I that when communicating with stakeholders, simpler is better.  No matter how good your data science project is, if it doesn't translate to those who make decision, it won't be used.  The kernal density estimation plot can show all the distributuion of the data (like a histogram), and is already normalized.  This is helpful because when wanting to look at subgroups within a larger dataset, a kernal density estimation plot can show them within a normalized pdf that is visually simple enough for stakeholders."
